=================================================================================================================

Trying searching the group name known as* w4nn4fl4g* in google we come across reddit group.

At first glance there are multiple memes and jokes in there.

But you can notice some deleted comments and users, so maybe looking and searching in **waybackmachine** => https://archive.org/web/ (url) will be a good idea because there are saved snapshots of the pages from the past so we might be able to see data that is not available as of right now !-)

Enter the url of the sub-reddit like so: https://www.reddit.com/r/w4nn4_fl4g/ and press on* Browse History* go to URLs tab where it's listing all the url's snapshots available related to the URL we've just entered.

After some searches we can discover that everything created and deleted from the dates 12/march - 12/march is the most relevant because it was deleted same day which suggests us it's probably **TOP SECRET** staff...

Narrowing our search we come across https://www.reddit.com/r/w4nn4_fl4g/comments/11p5w72/hiiiiiiiii_help/ URL which have two snapshots and the first one with a picture which states "hey guys how do i access the website", hmm, maybe the attackers website?

Digging dipper into that we can see in the URLs all the comments to the post, searching all reveals that this link: https://www.reddit.com/r/w4nn4_fl4g/comments/11p5w72/comment/jbw99ft/
Which turns out to have the early snapshot on the 12/march 05:09, going to it reveals a comment which states the following: "bruhhhh again NOT a meme. just post it as a question
anyways it's *wanna-flag-d60bf7cd-012a-4fcc-9a4c-e60eca6b653f-tlejfksioa-ul.a.run.app*"
And finally going to the link "wanna-flag-d60bf7cd-012a-4fcc-9a4c-e60eca6b653f-tlejfksioa-ul.a.run.app" reveals the flag in the page ==> **wctf{sp1nnnNn_tH3_cUb333e3E}**
